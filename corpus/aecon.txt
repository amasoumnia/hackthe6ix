Fraud Warning:  It has come to our attention that various international
organizations or individuals have been offering false employment opportunities
at Aecon Group Inc. These individuals will offer to fast track Canadian
working visa applications in exchange for a payment. Such offers are
fraudulent and intended to steal from the victims.  
  
Aecon Group Inc. employment policies and processes in Canada involve personal
interviews, and candidates who seek employment with us are never required to
pay us any sum of money. To do so would be contrary to our business conduct
guidelines and ethical practices. We take this matter extremely seriously and
are working with the appropriate legal authorities to shut down such
fraudulent schemes. Read more  here
