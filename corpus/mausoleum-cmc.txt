FEBRUARY 11, 2014::

Some opportunities in life are simply too good to pass up  a scenario that
happened recently when we acquired Pyrox Energies, Inc. Both companies were
established over 30 years ago in the province of Quebec, and now combined, we
will be able to offer state-of-the-art cremation equipment, refractory,
service and repair, as well as crematory accessories, in addition to industry-
leading mausoleum construction, glass-front niches, columbaria, bronze
accessories, and more.
