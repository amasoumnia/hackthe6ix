  What our clients say

>

> "Scott, I just want to pass on a huge Thank You to you and your team for
the quality work and the professional manner in which you conducted yourselves
while you were here." "It is a real benefit when we hire a contractor who
understands that we still have to conduct business throughout the renovation
process. Your staff were both courteous and respectful to our employees and
our customers while maintaining a meticulous and thorough work ethic."

> "We've had a long standing relationship with Frits and BBS. It dates back to
1987 when we had them build a car wash on our Carling Avenue facility. We were
extremely please with the finished product" For that reason, we had BBS back
on site at our Laperriere Avenue facility. They came in and did the work until
we were satisfied."

>

> Turpin Pontiac Buick Ltd.  Jean-Yves Laberge

> 

>

> "We've always had a very good and open rapport with the Bosmans and the
entire team at BBS, That's key when you're dealing with a large project. You
must have clear and understandable communication." "In 2005, BBS completed
renovation/retrofit that included a 21,000 square foot addition. This was
followed in 2008 by another 10,000 square foot retrofit."

> "We have purchased our Butler building in 2005. We are very pleased with our
building and proud to show it to our existing and potential customers. We
selected BBS Construction of Ottawa as general contractors for a complete
turnkey operation. BBS ascertained that the quality and workmanship was of the
highest standard. Any change order submitted was handled professionally and
expedited immediately." "BBS personnel made sure that everything went smoothly
in the purchase, delivery, construction and even post construction taking care
of minor issues which arise from time to time. In 2008, we chose BBS to build
a new facility in a remote location, La Ronge, Saskatchewan, again the
building was erected to the same standard. In summary, Helicopter Transport
Service has chosen BBS as their preferred General Contractor for any
Construction Program."

> "In April 2010 Bilberry Creek Baptist Church finally realized its dream by
adding a new sanctuary and foyer to the building BBS constructed for Bilberry
in 1993. BBS was key to a successful project according to the Phase 2 team."
"BBS managed all phases of the work from planning to painting in a very
professional and collegial manner, informing us continually as to progress,
problems and solutions. The BBS team used imaginative ways to reduce costs,
yet complete a visually stunning worship space. Bilberry looks forward to
working again with BBS when we add an educational and administration wing."

> Bilberry Creek Baptist Church  Richard Turle, Chairperson, Building
Committee and a Trustee Bilberry Creek Baptist Church

> 

>

> "There were a lot of companies, including from out of town that offered
their services, even at a lower cost than BBS." "But it's not the original
estimate that's important in the selection process, it's the confidence we had
in BBS to put up the building."
