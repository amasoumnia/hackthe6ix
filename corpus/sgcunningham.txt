  What our clients have to say...

The work was completed in four phases that allowed us to move employees in
stages, enabling business to continue as usual. This was particularly
important to us as we had hard deadlines that affected patient care and R&D
project deadlines for new product releases. SGC met each and every deadline.

Jim Nafziger  ,  Director, Systems and Supply Chain  
Unitron

Working with S.G. Cunningham has proved to be   by far   the best contractor
relationship we have had in our history. Their attention to detail, adherence
to timelines and ability to work around our business operation needs was
impressive.

Wendi Campbell  ,  Executive Director  
The Food Bank of Waterloo Region

From the moment we issued a Letter of Agreement, George was in full swing. He
was able to mobilize within days, communicated effectively and efficiently. He
and his team understood how to use their experience to move the job along. By
combining our efforts for scope retention and Georges teams appreciation of
our needs, we arrived under budget and on time. This is a level of business
trust that cannot be understated, especially in the contracting industry

Former Principal Negotiator and Manager, Commercial Affairs

We wanted to let you know how much we appreciate the care and attention S.G.
Cunningham provided during our kitchen renovation.  
We knew the quality would be second to none and that we were in good hands
throughout the scope of the project. The tradespeople  were courteous and
professional at all times and we were incredibly impressed with their work

vision for a project such as ours.
