  Welcome

At DCL , construction is our only business and we pride ourselves on
transforming our clients vision into a tangible reality. We love to be
challenged, however we also pride ourselves on having the discipline to say
no when a project is not within our core competence. Its our commitment to
focus on our strengths in order to surpass our clients expectations. We
strive to provide value-added services, honest advice, and to create a true
win-win partnership for DCL and our clients.

In todays business environment, being able to communicate easily and
effectively is one of the most important aspects of teamwork and success. At
DCL we are constantly exploring new tools and technologies to improve the
client experience and the communication information exchange to create a truly
collaborative process between the client and the design build team.

Completing your project on time and within budget is our primary focus so I
encourage you to browse our website and get to know more about our
construction services .

Sincerely,

Laura Radulescu  
President
